[WORK IN PROGRESS]

This Appointments web application is a hair salon booking system and follows the tutorial available on the book **Mastering React Test-Driven Development** by Daniel Irvine.  

My goal is to learn TDD in React and you can check my notes about this tutorial on the [NOTES](./NOTES.md) file.

## Overview

- This book includes the following topics:
  - Build test-driven applications using React 16.9+ and Jest
  - Build complete web applications using a variety of HTML input elements
  - Understand the different types of test double and when to apply them
  - Test-drive the Integration of libraries such as React Router, Redux, and Relay (GraphQL)
  - Learn when to be pragmatic and how to apply TDD shortcuts
  - Test-drive interaction with browser APIs including fetch and WebSockets
  - Use Cucumber.js and Puppeteer to build BDD-style acceptance tests for your applications
  - Build and test async Redux code using redux-saga and expect-redux

## How to install and run it

> I'll include this instructions after finishing the application
<!-- - Download the files, cd into root directory and run:
```bash
# Install dependencies

# Run the app
